title: Week 3 - git stands for git and not github

## git stash create history

I once took a quiz about Github with one of the questions being a True/False on if Github was purchased by Microsoft in 2018 (spoiler alert: true!). The pinnacle of learning!

Anyways, I think it's ironic that I've learned and know more about Github than about the broader topic of version control systems. It's like knowing how to make bagels without knowing what bread is (bread comparisons never grow mold). When I was in high school, I learned to tattoo `clone > add > commit > push` to my heart and if things weren't working, just delete the whole repo and try again.

Need to rebase? Cry.
Asked to force push? Throw up.
Dealing with a merge conflict? Cry and throw up.

## git commit -m "activity"

It's interesting how the CS curriculum doesn't include a specified and designated portion towards version control systems. Sure, it's probably not a basic algorithm to learn about but as a result of this negligence, you have people taking electives with the assumption that they should already know how to handle merge conflicts or start a pull request.

Which seems unfair?

Knowing that the working directory, staging area, and remote directory are theoretically all in the same folder but also **very very** different seems like an important enough distinction that can't simply be solved with the mantra `clone > add > commit > push`. In fact, I did an internship over the summer which required squashing, rebasing, resetting heads, and tagging. Technically all words I knew but none that I ever really truly understood. Knowledge of, and knowledge in, are two vastly different concepts that can't necessarily be solved by a string of Stack Overflow posts with the copied git error.

As such, I'm really glad to have done an git exercise that 1) recognizes different skill entry points and 2) was actually really fun. We did traditional git commands but we also did forking, maintaining upstreams (recently got a SodaStream so this made me especially bubbly), and the dreaded merge conflict. There was also intentions behind our actions. We need to know how to fork because we could be working on projects that don't allow us to write to them manually. We'll have to merge conflicts because they will happen.

I've participated in a number of projects where our only introduction into merge conflicts was all the steps needed to avoid them. That's great but also sometimes, through no one's fault of their own, merge conflicts happen. And when you see HEAD (Current Change) versus 412ilyalitya2sc0l0h0s (Incoming Change), I don't think that `Make sure to pull before you push` is really that helpful. It was cool to solve a merge conflict from a forked project whose upstream was since updated and it was cool to be able to write that sentence and understand what each of those words mean.

One thing to note while doing this activity, and really all git-related activities: there's always a mention of setting it up by adding your ssh key to your account.

To be completely honest, I have no idea what that means.

If Github ever released stats on which of its pages I visited the most, I undoubtedly believe that this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) would be first by a landslide. I understand it in concept but in action I'm always left fumbling towards all of its commands. Maybe one day I will venture into this bleak world that whispers about the ed25519 algorithm. Maybe.

## git status jim hall

This week, we also had an amazing talk by [Jim Hall](https://hallmentum.com/about/jimhall/). I really liked it. As someone unfamiliar with DOS, it was cool to get a technical aspect of a project and how one can go against previously restricted code to find their own creation (shoutout to [Ralph Brown](https://fd.lod.bz/rbil/)). But I also liked how his exposure to working with this community then led him to greater avenues.

During the talk, someone asked what the greatest challenge behind open source was and he talked about how sometimes the open source community and the projects behind it were being treated like they were vendors. Between constant demands for certain features or answers or complaints, the users failed to realize that the philosophy of open source is not conductive to the naive self-centered world that they have embarked upon. And having him talk about the **ethics** of open source reminded me of one of our very first lecture in OSSD.

In that lecture, we talked about the difference between Free and Open Source with the differences being an ideology versus a business model. When we were talking about Richard Stallman's original Four Freedoms, we talked about how he was, at times, branded a communist and how proprietary software was **the** business model. And hearing about Jim Hall's experience with people who used this open software and then made demands as if they were owed anything, was a bleak reality to the blights of open source. Because as a business model, there would always be those types of people who make egregious demands and if software is closed, wouldn't handling them be a little bit easier? The four freedom philosophy only works if there is a lack of people who will not abuse it. And there aren't.

Still, I can appreciate the nuance behind his thoughtful words and answers. It was nice to hear from someone who has lived and worked in the area we are learning about. Someone who can physically see the changes because he helped cause them. One answer I really liked hearing about was when someone asked if open source became more global over time and his response was that it was **always** global. There's something beautiful to knowing that from the very start, this philosophy has rang true to the minds of people all over the world.

Jim Hall has done a lot of talks about FreeDOS and open source outside of NYU. In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6NswAAKmbU) one, he speaks more on the technical side but does introduce the importance of having a purpose behind your creation (fun fact: freedos at the time of the video was the only dos software to have a twitter). I recommend it if you have the time.
