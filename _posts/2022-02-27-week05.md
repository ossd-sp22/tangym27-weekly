## the price of projects

Two questions:

- Why should you never trust atoms? Because they make everything up!
- Why should you not read my blogs consecutively? I write excessively and I used that joke before in an earlier blog.

When evaluating the [Atom](https://atom.io/) project, I was lucky to be able to work with a really great partner. It was a nice experience to be able to talk about a project's highs and lows. One thing he pointed out that was especially noteworthy was the differences between how the website and Github talk about the exact same feature. As noted in our [evaluation](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/project-evaluation/blob/main/atom_evaluation.md), when a user goes to their website and wants to install Atom, they probably don't want the complex lists of packages and nuances that are described in the instructions for installations on the Atom repository. In some ways, this difference makes sense. The website is likely more client-facing - those installing it are likely just users who want to use it while those installing it from Github want to actually look at the source code behind it.

As an open source project, and in another place and in other time, I think this could be a cool project to work with. Atom has such a meaningful [Contributing Page](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with advice on how to report bugs, code styles to follow, labelling instructions, and more. In an earlier blog, I talked about the impact of having a Code of Conduct, but the Contributing page is just as useful. Seeing so much thought and care being placed in a file that is meant to be welcoming and supportive to newcomers was such a pleasant surprise.

On the downside, the very nature and scope of this project definitely goes beyond my current skill set. A lot of their issues are not beginner-friendly (or at least tagged as such) and the open pull request page lacks conversations and discussions that are indicative of a good, welcoming first experience. It does seem like most of the pull requests are between the two maintainers of the project â€“ [icecream17](https://github.com/icecream17) and [darangi](https://github.com/darangi) â€“ while other prs get closed or just remain stagnant. Overall, their actions speak louder than their words and I don't think I am technically proficient enough to be able to contribute to a project of this vast nature (unless you count just using Atom as a text editor which I'm doing at this very moment!!).

## the price of education

Roughly two years ago, an [article](https://nyunews.com/news/2020/08/31/discrimination-asl-syllabus-against-low-income-students/) was released in the  Washington Square News about the content of one of the syllabuses in a Steinhardt class. The article called out the phrase

``"If you cannot afford the textbook and the DVD, then you cannot afford to take this class"``

There were a lot of responses to this â€“ as expected, most of them were negative. And coming from a school that is already notoriously known for its pricey tuition, that comment reeks of privilege and ignorance.


That's why watching the two videos about [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) and its [mission](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/live-talk-democratizing-knowledge) and its [movement](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/cracking-the-textbook) was really enjoyable.

Regarding the price of education â€“ regarding the price of sometimes outdated and obscure textbooks â€“ people are expected to sometimes pay hundreds of dollars every semester across four years. Erin, a student in the video, puts it best: "I know [$300] is not a big amount of money in the adult world but when you're a college student that is like millions." And then when you get the textbook, there are a few options that stem from having it:
- no usage: textbook becomes a one hundred dollar paperweight
- minimal usage: use of it when studying for a midterm or a weird homework question
- constant usage: great! but what will you do with the textbook when the semester is over?

Either way, gatekeeping education even more behind a paywall can be detrimental to the wellbeing of students. That's why you have so many people looking for PDFs of old textbooks or why the advice towards freshman students are always along the lines of "Wait a few days to see if the professor actually uses their textbook." The video emphasizes a point that I resonate deeply with: everyone should have access to knowledge and the ability to learn that knowledge.

As such, the core beliefs of OpenStax match so perfectly with those of open source in general. I commend the professors that actively try to make knowledge accessible in a field where that might not always work in their favor â€“ against institutions that also try to make their information proprietary. As a student, it is really easy for me to spout off some philosophical demands on the way the world works because in reality I have no idea the amount of work required to develop a curriculum, much less an open source one.

The video also mentioned how important it was to raise awareness and I couldn't agree more â€“ so here is my attempt:
  - [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - course lessons by MIT published for free on the internet
  - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - free supplemental educational resources
  - [Joanna!!](https://cs.nyu.edu/~joannakl/cs102_f21/syllabus.html) - Sorry, it's a bit too meta but back when I took Data Structures, one of our required textbooks was Data Structures and Algorithms. Now, while no textbooks are required, those that are recommended are typically open books like [OpenDSA](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/).

I know the blog title is suppose to be about the actual blog and I didn't do that here but given the current state of the world ... ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
