Hi! My name is Michelle :) !

### At NYU

I am a current junior majoring in CS. I was previously a CS tutor in Data Structures and worked at Stern briefly. I lived in New York my entire life so currently suffering from commuter life :( .

### Hobbies

Reading, playing Pokemon Go, and a disproportionate amount of listening to Taylor Swift.

### Favorite Joke

Think of tomorrow as the next day you'll eat nachos.
If that never comes, then tomorrow is nacho lucky day.
